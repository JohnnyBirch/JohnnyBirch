- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnnyBirch.  Anyone else encountering a problem accessing unstaked WAXP on EOSRIO.  Tokens have been unstaked for 24 hours yet EOSRIO indicates that I only have access to the .59 tokens that were available prior to my most recent unstaking. Is there a maintenance issue at EOSRIO?
